# Final-Project-Java
This is my final project in Automation Development course, HackerU College
It is online bistro app.
Screen1: A client is asked to enter his mail, age and order's date. Then click GO.
Screen 2: A client is invited to choose from drop down menues. If a client is naive enough to designate an age under 18, hot beverages menu will not be shown.
Screen 3: An order confirmation is sent to client's mail.
The app uses Excel tables as databases for menus it displays. It seems in bistro office they rather use Excel than SQL, Json or CSV :-)
